# **Hello!**

----

Welcome to NextXP OS, the operating system that brings back the old days to the web.

Just kidding, it's not an actual operating system!

But I hope it sure looks like one!

Also I'm not affiliated with Microsoft, Vercel, or any of those fancy companies.

Here is the stack:
- [__Next.js__](https://nextjs.org/) (hence the name, NextXP)
- [__MDX__](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)

Oh, and don't minimize the window, you can't get it back!
